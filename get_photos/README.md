# Getting data from SIS

Downloading from SIS requires autentication, so for these scripts to work, they need file *id* containing your currect session *id*, and file *idc* containing you current session cookie *idc*. Additionaly it needs file *sidents* containing sidents of your students. Then running get_all will try to download all photos of these students into directory out (if you don't have it create it).
